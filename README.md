# ApmTracker
Apm Tracker for processes

This will allow you to select an open process to begin tracking.
This will track your APM (Actions per minute) for the process only while it is in focus.

This can auto detect and start for processes you have already tracked manually once.

APM Track history is avaialable. (Though needs some work)
